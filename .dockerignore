# Docker
# You might *not* want to ignore the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
# in all cases.  Consider carefully.  But, often, you want to ignore
# build artifacts.
.dockerignore
docker-compose.override.yml  # Local overrides, often not needed in the build
# Don't ignore docker-compose.yml!  We need that.

# Data (Important!  Consider carefully)
# If you have any data files (e.g., CSV, JSON) that are *part of your
# application's code or are required for testing*, do NOT ignore them.
# However, if you have large datasets that are *generated* or *downloaded*
# during development, you SHOULD ignore them.
# data/  # Example: Ignore a 'data' directory if it contains large, generated data
# *.db   # Example: Ignore SQLite database files (if you were using SQLite)
